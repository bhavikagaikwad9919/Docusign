Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started with creating and running a .NET project:

1. Install .NET SDK (8.0 or later)

2. Verify Installation
Ensure that .NET is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
  `dotnet --version`

This should output the installed version of the .NET SDK (e.g., 8.0.100).

3. Create a New .NET Project
 - Open a terminal or command prompt.
 - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
 - Run the following command to create a new web application:

   `dotnet new web -n DocusignApp`
 - Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd DocusignApp`

4. Run the Project
- To run your .NET application:
- Ensure you’re in the project directory (`cd DocusignApp`).
- Use the following command to run the application:
  `dotnet run`

5. The application should start, and you’ll see output in the console indicating that it's running, usually on http://localhost:5000
